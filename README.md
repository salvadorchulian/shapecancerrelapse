The structure of this github is organised as follows:

###

# Result 1

## Step 1: Reading files

Input: Flow cytometry data files obtained in http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-Z68U, as a Folder, distinguished in two subfolders "Relapsed" (R) and "NonRelapsed" (NR) patients

Output: txt files, distinguished in two subfolders for R and NR patients, having deleted duplicates in data

## Step 2: Obtaining landmarks

## Step 3: Vietoris-rips in pairwise combinations

## Step 4: Statistical analysis

## Step 5: Random Forest

## Step 6: Vietoris-Rips for Biomarkers CD10-20-38-4 

## Step 7: Statistical analysis

Result 3

## Step 8: Creation of Persistence Images (PIs)

## Step 9: First steps in classification with PIs

## Step 10: SVM and LR for classification

## Step 11: SVM with/without upper sampling and all PIs together
